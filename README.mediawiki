== Features ==
The features added by this ZenPack can be summarized as follows. They are each detailed further below.
* Discovery of MySQL entities.
* Monitoring of MySQL Server and Database components.
* Event management and monitoring for certain MySQL states.
* Optional service impact with addition of Zenoss Service Dynamics product.

=== Discovery ===
The following entities will be discovered through ''zMySQLConnectionString'' property you provide. 
The attributes, tags and collections will be updated on Zenoss' normal remodeling interval which defaults to every 12 hours.
;Servers
: ''Attributes'': Full table scans, Slave status, Master status, Size, Index size, Data size
: ''Tags'': Name
: ''Collections'': Databases
;Databases
: ''Attributes'': #Tables, Default characted set, Default collation, Size, Data size, Index size
: ''Tags'': Name

=== Monitoring ===
The following metrics will be collected every 5 minutes by default. The ''Average'' statistic is collected, and the graphed value is per second for anything that resembles a rate.
;Servers

=== Event monitoring ===
According to the following MySQL states this ZenPack will trigger events with an appropriate summary message. 

;Device
: Critical event:
::* Invalid ''zMySQLConnectionString'' property,
::* Access denied for user with credentials provided in ''zMySQLConnectionString'' property.

;Service
: Critical event:
::* Invalid ''zMySQLConnectionString'' property,
: Warning event:
::* InnoDB Deadlock,
::* Slave error.

;Database
: Warning event:
::* Database existence.

=== Service Impact ===
When combined with the Zenoss Service Dynamics product, this ZenPack adds built-in service impact capability for MySQL. The following service impact relationships are automatically added. These will be included in any services that contain one or more of the explicitly mentioned entities.
;Service Impact Relationships
* Server failure affects related device.
* Database failure affects related server.

== Usage ==
To start monitoring your MySQL server you will need to setup connection to it as well as bind monitoring templates and modeler plugin to the device or device class containing your MySQL servers.

Use the following steps to start monitoring MySQL using the Zenoss web interface.
# Navigate to the ''Configuration Properties'' page of the device containing your MySQL servers (see [http://wiki.zenoss.org/File:Configuration_properties_panel.png]).
# Set user name, password and port in the appropriate fields of ''zMySQLConnectionString'' property (see [http://wiki.zenoss.org/File:Edit_zMySQLConnectionString_property.png]). For non-root users please make sure to grant all privileges to avoid access denied errors. Note that user name is required.
# Navigate to the ''Modeler plugins'' page of the device containing your MySQL servers, add the ''MySQLCollector'' modeler plugin and remodel the device. This will automatically find the MySQL servers and databases and begin monitoring them immediately for the previously mentioned metrics.

== Prerequisites ==
If you are using the commercial zenoss version and ''zends'', please make sure to create a symbolic link by executing the following command:
<code>ln -s /var/lib/zends/zends.sock /tmp/mysql.sock</code>

== Troubleshooting ==
If you encounter any issues with Zenpack instalation, please make sure that you have restarted zenoss after installation and your target disk has enough free memory and read permisions enabled. If device modeling failed, make sure that you have specified a correct user, password and port to your MySQL user account. Please grant all privileges to non-root users to avoid access denied errors (see <span class="plainlinks">[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/grant.html MySQL GRANT Syntax]</span>). In case of any issues when uninstalling this Zenpack, please remove all components first.

Note that device monitoring requires ''zenpython'' deamon to be constantly running. If you have just enabled monitoring, try pressing ''Zoom in'' to see the graphs. In case of any issues you can run zenpython daemon in foreground with <code>zenpython run -v10 -c</code> command and check if there are no exceptions. If zenpython runs without errors and prints monitoring data to stdout, then you should check if monitoring templates are bound to the components.

== Installed Items ==
Installing this ZenPack will add the following items to your Zenoss system.
;Modeler Plugins
* MySQLCollector
;Monitoring Templates
* MySQLServer(in /Server)
* MySQLDatabase (in /Server)
;Component Types
* MySQLServer (on related device)
* MySQLDatabase (on MySQLServer)
